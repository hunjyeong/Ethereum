# Ethereum based extremely small blockchain architecture

It was implemented in relation to Ethereum wallets and transactions. <br/><br/>
When creating a key in the wallet, it was checked that the mnemonic value was appropriately selected.<br/><br/>
When the transaction was executed, the signature was made and verified well.<br/><br/>
Regarding the tree or block, it is not perfect and needs to be modified.<br/><br/>
